Usage
========

Initially open the file "index.html" in your favourite browser.
In the map that is visible, you can mark the locations of your choice.
You can deselect a point by clicking on same marker thats visible.

As and when you mark, the latitude and longitude corresponding to that place will be displayed in 2 textboxes resinding next to map.
these will show the coordinates of last marked point on map.

Just enter the name corresponding to that location in the Name field and click "Add".this makes it added to an array of objects "locs".(each object contains 'name', 'lat', 'long').
then select or mark another point and keep adding.

After you have finished adding the locations, click on Draw Map button, that will mark all your points on another map.

the difference between 2 maps is 
			first is editable and second is not.
			
We'll get a static map link beside it and can be shortened.
this static map link will allow us to use this map anywhere. we can just copy paste the static map link or the shortened one and get our map.

Eg.
StaticMap link for marking IIITH, IIITB and IIITM-K is as follows:

http://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=17.379299,78.497314&zoom=5&size=800x512&markers=17.446035,78.349943&markers=12.844585,77.663212&markers=8.559367,76.879234&sensor=false

Shortened link is http://safe.mn/8Da


Code
====
The index.html, most of the part is usage of Placemarker API and some argument creation which is from net.

"get.js" is the file that is written by us for our purposes as a part of our application.

Shortnening of URL has been taken from http://safe.mn/tools/#automatic
